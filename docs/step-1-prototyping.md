# Hack Challenge "Welcome Passenger"
## Step 1 - Prototype your use case

The digital playground : provides a interface between sdv(python) and VSS implementation, realized in Java script.
Digital Playground is a open web based playground for digital.auto dev and provides a rapid prototyping environment for the validation of ideas for Software-defined Vehicle using COVESA vehicle APIs and Python.

There are approximately 700 VSS API's in CVI (connected vehicle interfaces), we have facilitated a mapping between VSS and the 3d model of the Vehicle, more description follows like dependencies and implementation.

Projects Library : There are different usecases like Smart vipers, Happy dog.
The button 'open' would redirect to a new page with the code related to prototypical implementation and the user interface.

The dashboard consists of all the vehicle components and application components similar to mockups.

The run button executes all the VSS API's and specific API's used can be known clicking the CVI button.

Dev language : Python (used for mapping)
API : VSS

Test environment : 3D animation for API calls
Why are we using Digital playground?
Rapid protyping without custom setup requirements.
Ideal platform for SDV innovation challenges and to Communicate key solution concepts.
Software defined vehicle  : helps in exploration and validation.

There are different types of API's Sensors and Actuators.
CVI catalogoue and Prototyping : CVI catalogoue provides the information about all the vehicle API's (sensors, actuators and branches).
and Protoyping provides the different vehicle models.

The different vehicle models provides further information to the usecases related to them, for example smart trailer corresponds to usecase ideal for problem statements related to smart trailer, and similarily smart truck Vehicle model corresponds to problem statement related to Truck.
