# Hack Challenge "Welcome Passenger"
## Step 1 - Prototype your use case
why ? Rapid protyping without custom setup requirements.
Ideal platform for SDV innovation challenges
Communicate key solution concepts.

software defined vehicle  : helps in exploration and validation.


The digital playground : provides a interface between sdv(python) and VSS implementation, realized in Java script.

there are different types of API's Sensors and Actuators.
CVI catalogoue and Prototyping : CVI catalogoue provides the information about all the vehicle API's (sensors, actuators and branches).
and Protoyping provides the different vehicle models.

The different vehicle models provides further information to the usecases related to them, for example smart vipers in Vehicle model : xxx is about : 

and similarily the .... in vehicle model xxx is about :
