# Hack Challenge 'Welcome Passenger'
## Step 3 - Extend your application and test locally

Your vehicle application transfered to a GitHub repository is now ready to be extended. Start Microsoft Vidual Studio Code and open our vehicle application. Detailed information you can find here: [Velocitas documentation - Starting development environment](https://websites.eclipseprojects.io/velocitas/docs/tutorials/quickstart/#starting-development-environment)

Depending on your ideated functionality for the 'Welcome Passenger' you could e.g. 
- Add cloud connectivity to trigger your applictaion or to provide information to the cloud
- Integrate a vehicle service that execute the request on vehicle side 

### Service Integration
We prepared the a seat service. You could use for example the your seat service (TODO add link) or create your own vehicle service.

You can validate the interaction of the service with your vehicle app by adding your vehicle service to the /app/AppManifest.json, [start the services](https://websites.eclipseprojects.io/velocitas/docs/tutorials/quickstart/#starting-runtime-services) locally and [debug](https://websites.eclipseprojects.io/velocitas/docs/tutorials/quickstart/#debugging-vehicle-app) them.
