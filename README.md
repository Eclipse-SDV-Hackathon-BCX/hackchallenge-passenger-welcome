# Eclipse SDV Hackathon on BCX2022
## Welcome to the "Welcome passenger" hack challenge! 

The goal is for a passenger to feel comfortable entering and using a vehicle. How should your own car or a car sharing car behave when a passenger approaches? Open the door or trunk? Adjust the seat and steering wheel position? Adjust the temparature?



This hack challenge focuses on encouraging creativity, trying out ideas in the form of rapid prototyping in a playground and transfer them easily to a working vehicle application using the Eclipse projects __Velocitas__, __Kuksa__ and __Leda__.

In this hack challenge, you can
- ideate your use case in easy way by using the provided playground,
- explore the Eclipse SDV ecosystem of open source projects, such as programming models, vehicle abstraction layer and protocol implementations.

Your hack team should have the following skills:
- Some development skills in Python
- Rudimentary Linux, git, shell skills are always a plus. 
- Some knowledge in network protocols such as MQTT is good.
- A bit of Docker, containerd, k8s experience would be good as well, for building your app as a container and deploy it to a container runtime on the device.

We would recomment the following steps for the hack challenge:

[Step 1 - Prototype your use case](/docs/step-1-prototyping.md)

[Step 2 - Transfer your prototype into a working application](/docs/step-2-generating.md)

[Step 3 - Extend the your use case with the component you need for you use case](/docs/step-3-exending.md)

[Step 4 - Build and deploy to a device](/docs/step-4-deploying.md)

Happy hacking!
