# Eclipse SDV Hackathon on BCX2022
## Welcome to the "Welcome passenger" hack challenge! 

The goal is for a passenger to feel comfortable entering and using a vehicle. How should a vehicle behave when a passenger approaches? Open the door? Adjust the seat to its size? This hack challenge focuses on encouraging creativity, trying out ideas in the form of rapid prototyping and transfer them easily to a working application using the Eclipse projects Velocitas, Kuksa and Leda.

In this hack challenge, you can
- ideate your use case in easy way,
- explore the Eclipse SDV ecosystem of open source projects, such as programming models, vehicle abstraction layer and protocol implementations.

Your hack team should have the following skills:
- Some development skills in a Python
- Rudimentary Linux, git, shell skills are always a plus. Some knowledge in network protocols such as MQTT is good.
- A bit of Docker, containerd, k8s experience would be good as well, for building your app as a container and deploy it to a container runtime on the device.

As we want to focus on the technology exploration and integration, consider the following steps as exemplary, you're free to chose your own set of technology of course.

Step 1 - Prototype your use case

Step 2 - Transfer your prototype to working application

Step 3 - Extend the your use case with the component you need for you use case

Step 4 - Build and deploy to a device
