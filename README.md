# Eclipse SDV Hackathon on BCX2022
## Welcome to the 'Passenger Welcome' hack challenge! 

The idea of the 'Passenger Welcome' use case is that the driver (or a passenger) is detected while he is approaching the vehicle. Based on this information, your _Welcome Vehicle Application_ could control a sequence of events, such as welcoming the passenger with a special lighting sequence (using lights outside and/or inside the car), automatically opening the door or trunk, adjusting the seat position according to driver preferences, the same for steering wheel position, HVAC, music, etc. â€“ there is no limitation to the creativity in this hackathon. What comes to your mind about how your own vehicle or a carsharing car should behave when a passenger approaches?



This hack challenge focuses on encouraging creativity, ideate ideas in the form of rapid prototyping in a playground and transfer them easily to a working vehicle application trying out them on a devide using the Eclipse projects __Velocitas__, __Kuksa__ and __Leda__.

In this hack challenge, you can
- ideate your use case in easy way by using the provided playground,
- explore the Eclipse SDV ecosystem of open source projects, such as programming models, vehicle abstraction layer and protocol implementations.

Your hack team should have the following skills:
- Some development skills in Python
- Rudimentary Linux, git, shell skills are always a plus. 
- Some knowledge in network protocols such as MQTT is good.
- A bit of Docker, containerd, k8s experience would be good as well, for building your app as a container and deploy it to a container runtime on the device.

We would recomment the following steps for the hack challenge:

[Step 1 - Prototype your idea of the 'Passenger Welcome' functionality](/docs/step-1-prototyping.md)

[Step 2 - Transfer your prototype into a working application](/docs/step-2-generating.md)

[Step 3 - Extend the your use case with the component you need for you use case](/docs/step-3-exending.md)

[Step 4 - Build and deploy to a device](/docs/step-4-deploying.md)

Happy hacking!
